# Castlegate IT WP Social Bar

Castlegate IT WP Social Bar is a WordPress plugin that adds fixed position social network links to a site. After installing and activating the plugin, you can add, edit, sort, and position the links on its options page in **Settings | Social Bar**.

## Changes since version 2.0

Version 2.x is **not compatible** with version 1.x of this plugin. The plugin no longer uses Advanced Custom Fields to manage its options. Therefore, links will need to migrated manually from version 1.x to version 2.x. Also, version 2.x uses the `wp_footer` action for output, so you do not need to modify your theme to display the links on your site.
